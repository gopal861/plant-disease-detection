# Plant Disease Detection using Deep Learning (CNN)

**Author:** Gopal Khandare  
**Role:**  Generative AI Engineer  
**Project Type:** Image Classification  



##  Overview

This is my **second project on GitHub** and my **first Deep Learning project**.

After completing a Machine Learning project, I wanted to move one step forward into **Deep Learning**, specifically **image-based problems**.  
This project focuses on building a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to detect plant diseases from leaf images.





##  Project Structure

| File | Description |
|-----|------------|
| `Plant_Disease_Detection.ipynb` | Main Jupyter Notebook (CNN workflow + explanations) |
| `requirements.txt` | Required Python libraries |
| `README.md` | 

> Note: The dataset is referenced but not uploaded due to size constraints.



##  Dataset Information

- **Dataset Name:** PlantVillage Dataset  
- Public image dataset of healthy and diseased plant leaves  
- Widely used in agriculture and deep learning research  

Each disease class is stored in a separate folder, making it suitable for CNN training using Keras data generators.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook


##  What I Did in This Project

- Explained the real-world problem of plant disease detection  
- Set up image preprocessing and data augmentation  
- Built an ** CNN architecture **  
- Compiled and prepared the model for training  
- Explained expected training behavior and results  
- Visualized learning trends conceptually  
- Documented every step clearly .




##  Model Behavior (Expected)

When trained on the PlantVillage dataset under normal conditions:

- Training accuracy typically reaches **~90–93%**
- Validation accuracy typically reaches **~85–90%**

Exact results depend on:
- Dataset split
- Hardware
- Random initialization



##  What I Learned

- How CNNs process and learn from image data  
- Difference between traditional ML and DL pipelines  
- Importance of preprocessing and architecture design  
- Why strong fundamentals matter before moving to Generative AI Engineering 




##  My upcoming  Project


My upcoming projects will focus on:

- Transfer Learning 
- More advanced Deep Learning architectures
- Generative AI
- End-to-End Generative AI SaaS applications
- LLM-based systems
- APIs
- User-facing AI products
